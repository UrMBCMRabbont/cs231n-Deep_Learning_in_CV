You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance.
